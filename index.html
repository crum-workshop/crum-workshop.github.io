                    <p>
                    The evolving landscapes of user modelling, adaptation, and personalisation necessitate a nuanced exploration of context and its impact on human-computer interaction. This evolution represents a paradigm shift towards placing the user at the centre of context representation, acknowledging the multifaceted nature of context as it intertwines with user needs, environmental changes, and technological advancements.  <br/>
                    The second edition of the Context Representation in User Modeling (CRUM) workshop, themed "<b>Human-Centric Context</b>", seeks to foster a comprehensive understanding of context by focusing on the dynamic interplay between subjective and objective contexts in enhancing user experience. We welcome submissions that explore the nuances of human-centric context across various domains, aiming to standardise context modelling practices that enhance user engagement, privacy, and trust in multi-stakeholder environments.

                                <p>This position paper aims to encourage researchers in the field of context-aware public transport information systems to incorporate human-centred approaches more deeply into their methodologies. Current context-aware systems in this domain often take a representational view and employ a data-first approach. Drawing on insights from previous work, we propose a distinction between the objective context and the experienced context. The experienced context incorporates interactions and perceptions to reflect better how we, as humans, experience the world. To measure this experienced context, we advocate for using qualitative research methods for HCI. To demonstrate this approach, we present the results of a focus group study on context in public transport. The results reveal that emerging experiences are shaped by a combination of various factors. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating user perspectives in designing context-aware systems. Therefore, in this paper, we take the position that if we want to improve the context-aware public transport information systems, we need to understand what travellers truly experience during their journey.</p>

                                <p>The ability to initiate gait involves a complex coordination between posture and movement, known as anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs). The emotional context in which gait initiation occurs can impact several spatio-temporal parameters, particularly the duration of APAs. While previous studies have used biologically relevant stimuli to induce emotions, such as images of pleasant or unpleasant scenes, to the best of our knowledge, the impact of the emotional context induced by music on gait initiation has not been explored yet. This paper presents a new dataset collected to study this impact. Objective biomechanical and physiological data were collected from participants during and after music listening, and subjective emotional responses were assessed using questionnaires. We also focused on two factors, liking judgment and familiarity, known to modulate emotions. Our preliminary analyses shows the impact of the emotional context induced by music on gait initiation, and confirms the strong importance of liking judgment and familiarity on the emotional context.</p>

                                <p>Monitoring and predicting user engagement is important to gauge the overall health of an E-commerce platform. A healthy active user-base indicates that the platform is able to retain users and is performing well on the user satisfaction metric. To measure the long-term user satisfaction, predicting return rate of a user is important. A frequent return of the user indicates that they are overall satisfied with the platform. To this end, we consider the problem of predicting user's return time on the platform given their historical interactions.

                                The current state-of-the-art models for user return time prediction are based on recurrent neural network, which models the sequence of user interactions and predicts the return time using a Temporal Point Process based formulation. However, it is well-known that the inference time for these models grow as the sequence length increases, due to the complex recurrent and gating mechanisms, which deems them unfit to be used in a real-time prediction setting. Towards this end, we propose a lightweight and simple neural bag-of-words based model for user return time prediction, which considers the user activity trail as a bag-of-words embedding model and performs simple aggregation operation, used for the prediction. We perform experiments on interaction log data from a major e-commerce company, and the proposed bag-of-words model outperforms the complex recurrence based neural network by <b>6.14%</b> and <b>4.81%</b> on average, in terms of the Root-Mean-Squared-Error and Mean-Absolute-Error, respectively. We also compare the inference time of our method to recurrent neural network based method, with an overall reduction of <b>78.5%</b> in terms of the wall-clock time.</p>

                                <p>Recent studies show that recommender system can be improved by using transformer-based approaches. Such models attempt to predict the next item based on the user's history of past interactions. Most of the recently proposed methods only consider a sequence of items and do not consider the moment of prediction. Although time-aware models have been developed in recent years, this area of research appears unstructured and difficult to replicate. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple yet effective method for making most next-item recommenders time-aware. We provide extensive experiments on two commonly used sequential recommenders, namely GRU4Rec and TiSASRec. Our results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

                                                <p>There has been a huge amount of research on personalisation. It has also moved well beyond the research lab and is widely used in real world applications, websites, and much more. A model of the user and their context drives that personalisation.  This, like many other forms of AI, have typically been inscrutable. This is because system builders have failed to prioritise the design of their systems so that the user can scrutinise the key elements of the personalisation process: the data used, the time and context of that data, the user modelling process and the personalisation. As the broad public increasingly calls for better understanding and control of smart systems, we need to establish ways for system builders to focus on scrutability from the design foundations, right through to system building and deployment. This talk will outline a vision for ways to do this, drawing on my team's previous work across diverse areas, ranging from learning, recommenders and smart buildings.

                                                <p>Judy Kay is Professor of Computer Science. She leads the Human Centred Technology Research Cluster, in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Sydney. A core focus of her research has been to create infrastructures and interfaces for personalisation so that people can scrutinise and control them. She has created such systems to support people in lifelong, life-wide learning. This ranges from formal education settings to supporting people in using their long-term ubicomp data to support self-monitoring, reflection and planning and includes medical contexts such as learning communication skills in medical settings. She has integrated this into new forms of interaction including virtual reality, surface computing, wearables and ambient displays. Her research has been commercialised and deployed and she has extensive publications in leading venues for research in user modelling, AIED, human computer interaction and ubicomp.  She has held leadership roles in top conferences in these areas and is Editor-in-Chief of the IJAIED, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (IJAIED), recent Editor and now Advisory Board member of IMWUT, Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technology (IMWUT) and Advisory Board member of ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems TiiS).

                    The goal of CRUM 2024 is to consolidate the various ways in which context is stored, retrieved, used, analysed, and interpreted by academicians, researchers, and users of a variety of user-facing systems. In that vein, we introduce the theme of this workshop: <b>Representation of Human-Centric Context</b>. "Human-centric context" can be defined as understanding and accounting for the dynamic interaction between the user model and the contextual environment. Such a paradigm shift aims to redefine the contextual landscape, a dynamic and multifaceted environment where contextual elements – ranging from physical settings over social dynamics to technological interfaces – interact and influence user experiences and behaviour. This landscape evolves with user needs, environmental changes, and technological advancements, representing the intricate web of variables that define human-computer interactions and user modelling. CRUM 2024 will explore the subjectivity of contextual information in anthropocentric technologies across various domains.

                            We are increasingly developing sophisticated systems which are aware of the context that they are used in, and intelligently adapt their behavior to this context. This keynote delves into the essence of 'context', acknowledging its diverse conceptualizations in literature, ranging from 'any information' to a few categories. Despite acknowledging that the relevance of context is domain-specific, it often remains unclear what is relevant specifically. <br/>
                            <!-- </p> -->
                                <div id="talk" class="collapse mb-3" id="keynote-talk1">
                                    <!-- <p> -->
                                        Technically, context representations aim to objectively capture measurable context elements. However, practical significance often lies at a different abstraction level, where a context element's relevance and meaning may shift based on how other context elements manifest. For instance, spacial coordinates have no immediate connection with the real word; their relevance and meaning are defined by what is there else. An individual's (past) experience further complicates relevance: Is it an arbitrary house or is the one where you grew up? Do you currently live there? It context could become more intricate if a stranger enters that house.<br/>
                                                    
                                        In this keynote address, I will embrace the subtleties of context, emphasizing that the compound of context elements matters, and underscoring that objective context representations may often only serve as proxies for truly significant experienced context.

                            <!-- We are increasingly developing sophisticated systems which are aware of the context that they are used in, and intelligently adapt their behavior to this context. This keynote delves into the essence of 'context', acknowledging its diverse conceptualizations in literature, ranging from 'any information' to a few categories. Despite acknowledging that the relevance of context is domain-specific, it often remains unclear what is relevant specifically. <br/> -->
                            <!-- </p> -->
                                <!-- <div id="talk" class="collapse mb-3" id="keynote-talk1"> -->

                                        <!-- Technically, context representations aim to objectively capture measurable context elements. However, practical significance often lies at a different abstraction level, where a context element's relevance and meaning may shift based on how other context elements manifest. For instance, spacial coordinates have no immediate connection with the real word; their relevance and meaning are defined by what is there else. An individual's (past) experience further complicates relevance: Is it an arbitrary house or is the one where you grew up? Do you currently live there? It context could become more intricate if a stranger enters that house.<br/>
                                                    
                                        In this keynote address, I will embrace the subtleties of context, emphasizing that the compound of context elements matters, and underscoring that objective context representations may often only serve as proxies for truly significant experienced context. -->

                                A core focus of her research has been to create infrastructures and interfaces for personalisation so that people can scrutinise and control them. She has created such systems to support people in lifelong, life-wide learning. This ranges from formal education settings to supporting people in using their long-term ubicomp data to support self-monitoring, reflection and planning and includes medical contexts such as learning communication skills in medical settings. She has integrated this into new forms of interaction including virtual reality, surface computing, wearables and ambient displays. Her research has been commercialised and deployed and she has extensive publications in leading venues for research in user modelling, AIED, human computer interaction and ubicomp. She has held leadership roles in top conferences in these areas and is Editor-in-Chief of the IJAIED, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (IJAIED), recent Editor and now Advisory Board member of IMWUT, Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technology (IMWUT) and Advisory Board member of ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems TiiS).
